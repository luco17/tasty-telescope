Swimming is a full-body workout, but the core is particularly important for swimmers. The core is the group of muscles that stabilizes the spine and pelvis and helps to transfer power from the upper body to the lower body. The core is engaged in every swimming stroke, from freestyle to backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly. A strong core helps swimmers maintain a proper body position in the water, reduce drag, and increase speed.

### Core exercises for swimmers:

#### Plank

Start in a push-up position, but instead of lowering yourself to the ground, hold your body parallel to the ground for as long as you can.

#### Russian Twist

Sit on the floor with your knees bent, hold a weight or medicine ball, and twist your torso from side to side.

#### Dead Bug

Lie on your back with your arms and legs in the air, lower opposite arm and leg towards the ground without touching the floor, then return to the starting position and repeat on the other side.

#### V-Ups

Lie on your back with your legs straight and arms straight above your head, then lift your legs and arms up to meet in the middle, forming a "V" shape.

#### Superman

Lie on your stomach with your arms and legs straight, lift both your arms and legs up and hold for a few seconds before lowering them back down.

#### Bird Dog

Start on all fours, lift one arm and the opposite leg up, then switch to the other side.

#### Bicycle Crunch

Lie on your back, bring one knee to your chest while touching the opposite elbow to the knee, then switch sides.

#### Side Plank

Lie on your side with your elbow and forearm on the ground, lift your hips up, and hold the position.

A strong core is essential for swimmers to improve their technique and speed. By incorporating these core exercises into your training routine, you can build the strength needed to excel in the water. Let us know your favorite core exercises and how they have helped you in your swimming journey.
